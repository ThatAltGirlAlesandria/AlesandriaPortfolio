    <h2>About Alesandria:</h2>
    <p class="column">I am a 30 year old woman, who currently resides in Vancouver, WA. I hava just finished my Associates of Science in General Science, with a focus on Computer Science and Business. I was able to achieve high honors while going to Portland Community College (PCC). I was invited to join Delta Alpha Phi and Phi Theta Kappa honor societies, and earned a spot on All Oregon Academic Team (AOAT) in 2022.</p>

    <p class="column">I have chossen to take a full year off between achieving my associates and starting my four-year-college journey. At the beginning of 2023 I was in a near fatal car accident, and was hospitalized for 12 days due to the severity of my injuries. I have now had four surgeries directly related to this accident. Due to this I have also been forced to take this entire year off of work. This has led me to the decison to start a coding bootcamp at Epicodus.</p>

    <p class="column">I believe that Epicodus will help me achieve my goal of being in the tech industry sooner than before. I am very excited for the journey and to add to my coding portfolio. Epicodus also makes sure to help us understand more about some sensitive topics such as race and sexism. This is something that I am excited about as I have been on a personal journey the last few years to better understand my own privillages and how to help stand up for those who have or are facing injustices.</p>
